[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/wifi75/Kronoterm-homeassistant)](https://github.com/wifi75/Kronoterm-homeassistant/releases)

A maintained fork by **Tiziano Cassone** ([@wifi75](https://github.com/wifi75)) of the original [Favio25/Kronoterm-homeassistant](https://github.com/Favio25/Kronoterm-homeassistant) integration. It supports Kronoterm heat pumps through the **Cloud API**, **Modbus TCP**, and **Modbus RTU**, with automatic migration of legacy entities.

## Enhanced fork fixes

- Migrates historical entity identifiers in place, preserving dashboards, custom names, and recorder history while removing duplicate registry entries.
- Isolates cloud cookies for every config entry, so multiple Kronoterm accounts cannot overwrite one another.
- Supports both Basic Auth and Kronoterm's web-session login during setup, with automatic heating/DHW endpoint detection.
- Detects loop availability from both installation flags and live loop payloads.
- Gives every energy entity an account-specific unique ID.
- Includes stricter dependency bounds, source linting, and a clean cross-platform checkout.

## Features

### 🌐 Multiple Connection Modes
- **Cloud API**: Internet-based connection using Kronoterm mobile app credentials
- **Modbus TCP**: Local network connection via RS485-to-Ethernet adapter
- **Modbus RTU**: Direct serial connection via RS485 (USB or GPIO)
- **Seamless switching**: Reconfigure between modes without losing entity history

### 🌡️ Climate Entities (Modbus Mode)
- **6 Climate Controls**: DHW, Heating Loop 1-4, Reservoir
- **Smart Temperature Sensors**: Automatically prefers thermostat temperature over loop temperature
- **Direct Control**: Set target temperatures with instant feedback
- Example: Loop 2 displays room temperature (23.2°C) from thermostat instead of loop outlet temperature (27.8°C)

### 📊 Comprehensive Monitoring
- **100+ Sensors**: Temperatures, pressures, energy consumption, operational hours
- **Binary Sensors**: Status indicators for pumps, compressor, heating/cooling modes
- **Switches**: Control system operation, reserve source, additional source with **instant UI feedback**
- **Number Entities**: Adjust temperature offsets and setpoints
- **Select Entities**: Change operation modes and working functions

### ⚡ Performance & Features
- **Fast Polling**: Configurable update interval (5-600 seconds)
- **Optimistic Updates**: Switches update instantly when toggled (Modbus mode)
- **Energy Dashboard**: Full integration with Home Assistant energy tracking
- **Automatic Controller Detection**: TT3000/TT4000 detected and mapped automatically
- **Connection Resilience**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for cloud authentication

![Cloud API Setup](images/form.png)

1. Select **Cloud API** as connection type
2. Enter your Kronoterm mobile app username and password
3. Configure update interval (default: 60 seconds)

### Modbus Setup

The integration supports both **Modbus TCP** (network) and **Modbus RTU** (serial) connections.

#### Option 1: Modbus TCP (via RS485-to-Ethernet Adapter)

**⚠️ Hardware Requirement:**  
Kronoterm heat pumps use **Modbus RTU** (RS-485) by default and do not have built-in Modbus TCP support. You need a **Modbus RTU to TCP adapter** to use network-based Modbus.

**Recommended adapters:**
- [USR-TCP232-410S](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008374731458.html) (Ethernet)
- Elfin EW11 (WiFi option)
- Waveshare RS485-to-Ethernet
- Any RS485-to-TCP converter with configurable serial settings

**Adapter configuration:**
- Baud rate: 19200
- Data bits: 8
- Parity: None (N)
- Stop bits: 1
- Protocol: Modbus RTU

Once connected, configure the integration:

1. Select **Modbus TCP** as transport type
2. Enter your adapter's IP address
3. Port: `502` (default)
4. Unit ID: `20` (default)
5. Update interval: `5-600` seconds

**Finding your adapter's IP address:**
- Check adapter documentation (web interface or LED display)
- Or find it in your router's DHCP list

#### Option 2: Modbus RTU (Direct Serial Connection)

**Hardware Requirement:**  
Direct RS-485 connection from your Home Assistant host to the heat pump.

**Required hardware:**
- USB-to-RS485 adapter (e.g., Waveshare USB to RS485)
- Or GPIO-based RS485 HAT for Raspberry Pi

**Configuration:**

1. Select **Modbus RTU** as transport type
2. Serial port: `/dev/ttyUSB0` (or your device path)
3. Baud rate: `19200` (default)
4. Data bits: `8`
5. Parity: `None`
6. Stop bits: `1`
7. Unit ID: `20` (default)
8. Update interval: `5-600` seconds

**Finding your serial device:**
```bash
ls /dev/tty* | grep -E "USB|AMA"
# Common paths: /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyAMA0, /dev/ttyS0
```

**Note:** Ensure Home Assistant has permission to access the serial port (may require host mode or device mapping in Docker/VM setups).

### Energy Monitoring

**Reimport warning:** Reimporting energy statistics clears existing statistics. Short‑term (hourly) bars may disappear until Home Assistant rebuilds them from recorder history.

## Key Differences: Cloud API vs Modbus

| Feature | Cloud API | Modbus TCP | Modbus RTU |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Connection** | Internet required | Local network (adapter) | Direct serial (RS485) |
| **Speed** | ~60s refresh | 5-600s configurable | 5-600s configurable |
| **Reliability** | Depends on cloud | Direct connection | Direct connection |
| **Hardware** | None | RS485-to-Ethernet | USB/GPIO RS485 adapter |
| **Climate Entities** | Limited | Full support (4 entities) | Full support (4 entities) |
| **Sensors** | ~80 entities | ~120 entities | ~120 entities |
| **Offline Operation** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Advanced Features

### TT3000 Controller Support
The integration automatically detects your controller type (TT3000 or TT4000) and loads the appropriate register map:
- **TT3000**: Compact register set with 100+ sensors
- **TT4000**: Extended register set with 120+ sensors
- **Auto-detection**: No configuration required - works out of the box

**Note**: TT3000 controllers may have different register availability (e.g., no antilegionella or DHW circulation switches).

### Optimistic Switch Updates (Modbus)
When toggling switches in Modbus mode, the UI updates **instantly** without waiting for the next poll cycle:
- Immediate visual feedback
- Coordinator data updated after successful write
- Eliminates lag between action and UI response

### Cloud Connection Resilience
Automatic retry logic handles transient connection issues:
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1.5s, 3s)
- Graceful handling of temporary network failures
- Seamless fallback between authentication methods

### Reconfigure Flow
Switch between Cloud API and Modbus modes without losing entity history:
1. Settings → Devices & Services → Kronoterm
2. Click **Reconfigure**
3. Choose new connection type
4. All entity IDs, history, and dashboard references preserved

### Climate Entity Temperature Mapping
Modbus climate entities intelligently select temperature sensors:
- **Priority 1**: Thermostat temperature (room temperature)
- **Priority 2**: Loop temperature (outlet temperature)
- **Result**: Shows the most relevant temperature for each loop

Example:
- Loop 1 (no thermostat): Shows loop outlet temperature (38.9°C)
- Loop 2 (with thermostat): Shows room temperature (23.2°C) ✨

### Writable Registers
Modbus mode supports direct register writes:
- Temperature setpoints via climate entities
- Temperature offsets via number entities
- System control via switch entities

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Showing
- Verify files are in `custom_components/kronoterm/`
- Restart Home Assistant
- Check logs: Settings → System → Logs

### Cloud API Issues
- Verify credentials match Kronoterm mobile app
- Check internet connection
- Some sensors may show as unavailable (normal)

### Modbus Connection Failed
- Verify IP address is correct
- Check port 502 is accessible (firewall)
- Ensure Unit ID is 20 (default)
- Try pinging the heat pump IP

### Entities Unavailable
- **Cloud API**: Some registers not available via cloud (expected)
- **Modbus**: Check network connection and unit ID
- Use reconfigure flow to refresh
